Hey, I'm Fioncat (Wenqian), an unknown developer.

No significant achievements, no experience in big tech companies, and no contributions to well-known open-source projects. However, I have a passion for coding and am willing to dedicate myself to it.

Currently, I am working in the field of Cloud Native(<del>Cloud Naive</del>), and my past and ongoing activities include:

- Kubernetes: Setup various business applications, clusters of different specifications; delved into Kubernetes source code for issue troubleshooting; wrote operators, cluster management platforms, and various plugins like CNI, IPAM, CSI, CloudProvider, ClusterAutoScaler, SchedulerExtender; adapted Nvidia GPUs for AI training and inference. Proficient in Kubernetes components, operation modes, and skilled in various client-go coding styles, <del>yaml boy</del>.
- Cloud Native Ecosystem: Engaged with the Cloud Native ecosystem around Kubernetes and the broader Cloud Native scope beyond Kubernetes. Familiar with projects such as Istio, Jaeger, Cilium, KubeVirt, KubeEdge, CloudEvents, and constantly exploring practical applications for these excellent projects.
- Containerd, Docker, CRIO: Developed low-level plugins; implemented container micro-VMs based on Firecracker; created image on-demand loading using eStargz+FUSE+NFS (similar to Nydus) for elastic AI training tasks on Kubernetes. In-depth understanding of container and image underlying structures.
- API Gateway: Contributed to gateway infrastructure, wrote APISIX plugins using LUA, and developed a complex k8s APISIX operator, integrating the gateway with Ingress.

I don't fit the traditional backend developer mold; I'm more involved in the company's infrastructure work. You could say I'm in an intermediary role between operations and development, or perhaps, an "Ops Developer."

Technology, for me, is not just a job; it's a hobby. I enjoy tinkering with various computer-related things during business hours and beyond, including:

- ArchLinux: A devoted Arch Linux fan, I exclusively use ArchLinux for development. In my free time, I actively participate in discussions in the Arch community and have contributed to the [ArchLinux concise guide](https://arch.icekylin.online/).
- Neovim: I've been using Vim since I started coding, and Neovim is currently my favorite Vim editor. I've contributed to [ayamir/nvimdots](https://github.com/ayamir/nvimdots) and [neovim/nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig).
- Rust: My current favorite programming language. All my hobby projects are developed in Rust. I'm in the learning phase (<del>who knows how many times I've started</del>), and its exquisite compiler design truly captivates me. I hope to find Rust-related development opportunities.
- Reading and Blogging: Despite my role in Ops development, I maintain enthusiasm for traditional backend topics. I regularly read computer books on databases, networks, concurrency, and more.

I love the open-source community and actively participate in it. I hope to contribute more to the community in the future.

Yes, that's me - an introverted, unknown programmer who silently loves everything about computers.
